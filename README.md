# CI4R-TOBB4

This dataset was collected with a 4 GHz continuous-wave (CW) radar for human activity recognition.  It represents a large subset of the data used in the aftermentioned paper.

## Details about radar utilized:

- ​Radar measurements were made in an indoor laboratory environment spanning a range of 1–5 m using an NI-USRP2922 model software-defined radio platform programmed to transmit a continuous wave signal at 4 GHz.
- Two SAS-571 antennas having a 48 deg. azimuthal beam width were mounted along with the USRP 1 m above the ground.
- Measurements were taken such that the direction of motion were directly aligned with the center of the antenna beam pattern.
